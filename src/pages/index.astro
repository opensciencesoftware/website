                    <dl>
                        <dt>When will the OSSF be fully established?</dt>
                        <dd>The OSSF is in the process of becoming a legal Foundation in the state of Catalonia. We hope to be fully operational within 2025.</dd>

                        <dt>How do you select projects?</dt>
                        <dd>We are currently defining the procedure for project selection. Projects will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the board of trustees. If you have a project that you think would be a good fit for the OSSF, please fill in this form to get in touch.</dd>

                        <dt>How does governance work?</dt>
                        <dd>The Board of Trustees is responsible for fulfilling the foundation’s mission and managing its resources. The first board is composed of members of the nf-core steering committee and Paolo. Going forward the Board will self-appoint new trustees. Trustees serve for two-year terms and may be re-elected indefinitely.</dd>

                        <dt>Does Seqera own the OSSF?</dt>
                        <dd>No. Seqera has no legal or financial interest, the Foundation is a public good and a completely separate entity.</dd>

                        <dt>How do you manage conflicts of interest?</dt>
                        <dd>Trustees must avoid conflict of interest and declare to the board any that might arise. In order to avoid conflict of interest stemming from employment or commercial interests, the trustees come from varied backgrounds.</dd>

                        <dt>Does the OSSF hire developers?</dt>
                        <dd>The OSSF does not plan to be an employer - rather a distributor of funds. The foundation can pay for expenses such as invoices sent from institutions or self-employed contractors. The OSSF is not an employer - only a distributor of funds. The foundation can pay for expenses and pay invoices sent from institutions or self-employed contractors.</dd>

                        <dt>Does all nf-core activity have to go through the foundation?</dt>
                        <dd>No - institutions can (and should) continue to apply for funding to work on projects related to nf-core. The OSSF acts as a fiscal sponsor: an additional entity which can be used to apply for and distribute funds.</dd>
